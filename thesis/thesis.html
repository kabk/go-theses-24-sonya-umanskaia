    <p><em>«Now Iapetus took to wife the neat-ankled maid Clymene, daughter of Ocean, and went up with her into one bed. And she bore him a stout-hearted son, Atlas: [510] also she bore very glorious Menoetius and clever Prometheus, full of various wiles […]. And Atlas through hard constraint upholds the wide heaven with unwearying head and arms, standing at the borders of the earth before the clear-voiced Hesperides; [520] for this lot wise Zeus assigned to him.» – Hesiod, Theogony, 700BC.</em></p>
    <p>The Atlantic Ocean spans between the North and South Americas, Africa, and washes the western coast of Fortress Europe. It is the greatest multi-continental body of water which plays a huge role in shaping the intercultural and economical relationships between the communities living on its coast, movements of peoples, knowledge and goods. It influences the wind, temperature and water levels in the surrounding territories (ESA), breaking the rocks of one shores and flooding others.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The landmass now covered by the North Sea, here referred to as Doggerland, has had an important but neglected influence on the course of prehistory in northwestern Europe. The physical character of Doggerland in the Late Glacial and earlier Holocene is assessed, together with its re-colonization by humans after the Last Glacial Maximum. The development of a maritime-based society along the northern coast of Doggerland is postulated, and it is argued that the coastal inhabitants, with their specialized adaptation to this zone, will have moved with the coast as relative sea-levels changed. The interactions of coastal and inland populations are considered, including the probable influence of the coastal groups in delaying the spread of farming into the region.<br />

    <p>The Netherlands, «lower land» (<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/Netherlands#etymonline_v_35463"><u>Online Etymology Dictionary</u></a>, visited in 2024), has been fighting with water element from time immemorial (Pytheas of Massilia, c.325 BCE). The whole existence of the country is dependant on its flood defence structures with a total length of about 3500 km, in absence or failure of which 60% of the Dutch land would be covered by the North Sea. Living in the constant struggle for their land, the Dutch learned to cherish every square centimetre of it. And along with cherishment came control, dividing the entire territory into squares and rectangles, complex structures of canals, dikes, dams and floodgates. It is a country so perfectly designed that it abhors any interventions from the outside. And yet, in 1940 the perfect arrangement of infrastructure was brutally interrupted by the German troops invading the Netherlands.</p>
    <p>Holland’s foreign policy principle was neutrality in order to avoid involvement in international conflicts<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Due to the former article 117 of the Criminal Code, Dutch people were convicted for insulting and criticising Adolf Hitler policy (Herrenberg, T. (2022, June 1).<br />
    <br />
    </span></span>, and after one day of bombing Rotterdam, on the 15<sup>th</sup> of May 1940, the Dutch government surrendered to the Nazi German army (Werner Warmbrunn, 1963). Therefore, the control over the land passed into hands of German Reich.</p>
    <p>However, the course of the war deviated from the intended direction. The attempt to attack Great Britain met with failure, the Soviet Union held its positions against the German army's pressure, and the United States also joined the resistance effort. It became evident that the initial strategy of aggression and territorial expansion had to be discarded in favour of a defensive approach to protect the occupied territories. Confidence in the invincibility of the Wehrmacht wavered. In 1942, Hitler got an ambitious idea to build a complex of fortifications along the European coast in order to prevent the Allies assault on the invaded territories. The project has received a name of the Atlantic Wall. A grandiose title inspiring reverential fear on the scale of the giant that was to be erected along the Atlantic coast.</p>
    <p>Atlas, an ancient Greek Titan, the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Clymene (Hesiod, Theogony, 700BC), has lent his name to the Atlantic Ocean, the body of water behind the Pillars of Heracles. He is doomed to perennially hold the skies on his shoulders as a punishment for joining the Titans against the Olympians during Titanomachy, the Battle of Gods. <em>«[Atlas] himself holds the tall pillars which keep earth and heaven apart»</em> (Homer, The Odyssey. VIII century BC). After he refused to give shelter to Perseus, the latter turned him into a mountain range (Polyidus c. 398 BC). And like the Atlas Mountains, the Atlantic Wall stretches from Norway till the Franco-Spanish border like a spine of a fallen giant.</p>
    <p>The Wall extends for 6,200km, and initially was supposed to consist of 15,000 heavy bunkers with walls 2 meters thick but due to the insufficiency of the building process, lack of manpower and materials only 6,000 were completed, 510 of which could be found in the Netherlands. However, other 2,000 fortifications were realised, along with tens of thousands of lighter bunkers and brickwork buildings. Around 17 million cubic meters of concrete and over a million tons of steel was used for production. The Wall actually consisted of a series of bunkers, manmade barriers and natural obstacles like cliffs and rocks. It was built by the efforts of approximately 260,000 civilians unfortunate enough to live on this land. Built by the forces of prisoners brought from other countries. Built to protect those who captured this land from those to whom it belongs.</p>
    <p>The consequences of the Wall construction in the Netherlands were quite tragic. Thousands of houses were demolished, and thousands of people were resettled to the remote parts of the country, the majority of which never came back to their original place of settlement. Towns such as Ter Heijde and Petten almost disappeared completely from the map, while in Hook of Holland, Hellevoetsluis and IJmuiden the historical centres and 19<sup>th</sup> century fortifications were restructured for the needs of the army<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">For example, they placed a gun bunker on the ramparts of a 19th century fortress in Hellevoetsluis and converted an ammunition chamber in Fort Hook of Holland, also from the 19th century, to a bread bakery for Festung Hook of Holland. The sea front of Fort Erfprins, dating from the French Period, in Den Helder, was used for the construction of an anti-aircraft battery (https://geschiedenisvanzuidholland.nl/).<br />
    <br />
    </span></span>. The forests were cut down, and many residential buildings, as well as architectural heritage and natural sites, were demolished to clear the space and for construction materials<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">For the sake of building the wall, thousands of houses, seven schools, three churches and two hospitals had been torn down.

    <p>The appearance of The Hague has been changed almost beyond recognition. The Wall was cutting through the streets, interrupting the movement; the access to the beach was closed, and the previously lively Scheveningen has turned into a sullen line of defense.</p>
    <p><img src="media/image1.png" style="width:15.09722in;height:9.05556in" /></p>
    <p>Perhaps, the main purpose of the Atlantic Wall was not only protection from the Allies, but a psychological warfare and reinforcement of propaganda. In the beginning, the project was called the «New West Wall», referring to the previous fortification system, The Siegfried Line («Westwall» in German), built in 1936-40 from Kleve to the town of Weil am Rhein. But quickly enough the title changed to the one known now. It was intended to convey a sense of strength and invincibility. By associating the defensive structure with the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean, the Germans sought to create an image of an impregnable defense that would discourage the enemy from invasion. <em>“The fortress had important psychological value, for it tended to unite the occupier and the occupied in the fear of being swept away; the fortress provided unity and identity where there was none”</em> (R. G. Nobécourt).</p>
    <p>Ancient Greek mythology played an important role in the formation of Nazi ideology of superiority complex and intimidation. In his most famous and deeply contrioversial prohibited work by now, Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler described the representatives of the ‘superior’ race, the Aryan, as “the Prometheus<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Prometheus, according to the mythological genealogy, was the brother of Atlas.<br />
    <br />
    </span></span> of mankind” (Johann Chapoutot, 2016). The image of the Olympic gods and Prometheus specifically was highly abused by the Reich regime<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The Reich post office, <em>Reichspost</em>, even issued a stamp with the profile of Prometheus holding the torch before the Brandenburg Gate in 1938, to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the seizure of power. (Greeks, Romans, Germans How the Nazis Usurped Europe’s Classical Past, Johann Chapoutot. 2016)<br />
    <br />
    </span></span>. It was important to glorify the regime as much as possible using all means of propaganda, especially referring to something so archetypical as Greek mythology which had a huge influence on the development of European culture. Stereotypical images of highly masculine god-like men are deeply rooted in the European collective consciousness as a representation of the highest power (The making of Europe: conquest, colonisation and cultural change, 950-1350; Bartlett, Robert. 1994). However, the use of the metaphor of the Titan punished for his arrogance and condemned to be eternally chained to a rock and daily attacked by an eagle, seems to have foretold the short-lived existence of the fascist empire and its downfall. Like Atlantis, the mythical island, “a confederation of great and marvelous power” (Plato. "Timaeus". Translated by R. G. Bury. Loeb Classical Library. Section 24e-25a.), eventually sank beneath the water, so too the bunkers of the Atlantic Wall, intended to embody strength and intimidation, are gradually, piece by piece, sliding into the waves of the North Sea.</p>
    <p><del>The presence of the bunkers seem to reveal the prospect of their use in the coming future. <em>Never forget</em> turns into <em>When will it happen again?</em> In the current years, the world closely watches two horrifying conflicts unravelling in front of our eyes: Russia-Ukraine (began on 24<sup>th</sup> February 2022) and Israel-Gaza (the conflict took a new round of escalation on 7<sup>th</sup> October 2023). Since the former is the first war in decades happening on the territory of European land and was started by the successor country of the USSR, a threat to the Western ideologies, it triggers not yet healed traumas of the Soviet occupation, and raises fear of the recapture. Bordering countries are striving to improve their military capacity, join NATO or buy the ammunition from the stronger states, enhancing the boarder control, calling on the population to be prepared and</del> <del>vigilant. As people become more aware of wars happening around the globe, reemergent nuclear threat (no matter how real it is), the paranoia grows, tension increases, and the questions what to do if the combat comes to one’s land, how to protect oneself start to</del> <del>rise.</del></p>
    <p>In his book <em>Bunker Archeology</em> (1994), Paul Virilio writes about how the war machine becomes an archetype of the industrial machine. And indeed, if we look closely at the history of the food, economic, clothes, technological industries, and especially urban planning, we can see that the crucial developments in all of them were triggered by the necessity to attack the other or, on the contrary, to protect oneself. The major European cities are constantly in passive, suppressed anticipation of the start of a new war, and governments do not loosen their grip on the development of military technology. The bunkers still stand, somber and neglected, as if waiting for their time to come again.</p>
    <p>How many cities have the list of bomb shelters in open access, and what does it mean? Would the bunkers left from the Atlantic Wall be still useful in case of potential attack? And how much people are aware of them?</p>
    <p>It is important to mention that some of the Second World War bunkers in the Netherlands were used as high-security command posts during the Cold War, and some of them are now used as Dutch military bases.</p>
    <p>In Oostduinen, in The Hague, there is a peculiar place. It is located right at the transition from the city to the dunes, behind the International Crime Court and Monument Bombardment Alexander Barracks. While cycling towards the picturesque nature site, one can notice a tall building of a weird shape, surrounded by a fence with barbed wire, dozens of surveillance cameras and people patrolling the area. Sometimes, an incomprehensible high-pitched sound comes from it, but most of the time sounds of gunfire and barking dogs can be heard around. This building is NATO Communications and Information Agency. Standing on its own in the middle of a nature site, towering above the dunes, it seems to not draw much attention. Obscure in its purpose and form from the first sight, it somehow seems like an integral part of the landscape. People come here to run, walk with their dogs or just have a routine stroll around without questioning too much what does the landscape surrounding them holds within itself.</p>
    <p>Just at the beginning of the running path, opposite to the NATO building, stands a wall on its own, detached from anything, enclosed with a fence from one side. This is one of the remaining parts of the Atlantic Wall, disguised between trees and bushes. Eventually, the wall abut another fence with a VERBODEN TOEGANG sign on it; behind this fence a military base locates, and a bit further in the dunes – a water pump.</p>
    <p>The Netherlands is a country built on a compromise with water. Always in danger of flooding, the Dutch learned to subjugate inundation and use it for protection of their land, with great difficulty retrieved from the sea. This knowledge reached the best use in the construction of the Dutch Water Defence Line, a massive defence system extending for more than 200km around the Netherlands made for protection of the most important parts of the country. Laid in 1815, highly renovated from 1837 and finished around 1940, this structure becomes a great example of subjugation of the landscape to warfare and controlled destruction. Artificial peninsulas shaped as a polygon with pointed protrusions are spread around the country, barely noticeable from the ground but striking with their precise geometry when viewed from above. Before they used to be crucial parts of the military infrastructure , same as numerous dikes, specially dug reservoirs of a certain depth (exactly 40cm, deep enough to make enemy advance impossible, but not enough to navigate by boat), and a complex system of canals which were supposed to bring water to the lowlands and flood fields and villages<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This controlled inundation had a long-term consequences of not only making the advance impossible for the enemy, but also prevented the farmers from cultivating land: salt from the sea water dried the ground and made it infertile for 6 years after.<br />
    <br />
    </span></span>. By sacrificing chosen parts of the land, the Dutch tried to protect other areas. Before the First World War, the canals in Amsterdam (Defence line of Amsterdam) were rebuilt in such a way that in case of blockade of the city the preselected people could sustain themselves for a few months without the connection to the outside<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Describe who had to be saved and find the source<br />
    <br />
    </span></span>. The only weakspot of this system was a dike controlling the access of fresh water to the city. If it was captured by the enemy, the Netherlands would have to capitulate. Thus, water became an element fulfilling two fundamental human needs: quenching thirst and providing protection.</p>
    <p>Because of the unique application of the principal of temporary inundation in military defence system and use of concrete as a building material for forts and bunkers (which never happened before on such a scale), the Dutch Water Defence Line was added to the UNESCO heritage list (UNESCO website, visited in 2024). However, the technology of building with concrete and steel instead of stones and bricks was also used for the construction of the bleak double and, simultaneously, the opposite of the Dutch Waterline – the Atlantic Wall. Erected by the enemy forces but serving the same purpose, holding back the attack but of liberators' on the invaders. Both of them had a great ambition of an impossible absolute protection of the state, despite the sacrifice of people and infrastructure, an indelible mark which it left on the landscape; and both didn’t manage to unfold the inherit potential. The Dutch Waterline had barely held any combat and been used as intended. In the end of WW2, the Germans occupied it and blew up the upper dikes to flood the territories and not let the Allies to continue the attack, ruining the system and making it impossible to use ever again. By turning what was meant to stop the German army into their weapon of defense, the whole idea of the Line was perveted. As if having lost its meaning, it simultaneously lost its strategic significance, which over time, due to the expansion of cities and an increase in population, became equal to zero. Nevertheless, sparse remains of forts, bunkers and fortified towns are scattered across the land, phantoms of the war, forming a traumascape of the dark times under occupation.</p>
