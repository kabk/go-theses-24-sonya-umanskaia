<h4 class="title" id="abstract">Part I</h4>

<p class="quote">This project derived from my personal fascination with creativity, the imaginary, death, and memory and how they are interconnected. I am interested in the human need to depict, remember, and the need to feel remembered. Many attempts have been made to achieve immortality through different methods, time periods, and cultures; let it be physical or the immortality of the soul; however, the one I will be researching is creative and biological symbolic immortality perceived through the lens of memory.</p>

    <p>“I remember staring into her eyes not saying a word as time stood still. I finish my espresso and share a small smile with the world. A smile with a dash of pain and a spring of love.

    <p>Many aims have been made to achieve immortality through different methods, time periods, and cultures. Each religion has its own interpretation of life, death, and what happens after it. Numerous are known for promising an afterlife, like Judaism, Islam, and finally, Christianity, which has through the decades successfully profited off people’s guilt and fear of death. From the Egyptians saving bodies in the tombs in pursuit of the spiritual afterlife, to the Alchemist's desire to obtain the elixir of life to become immortal or the Buddhistic belief of reincarnation that also suggests continuity. Within the realm of physical immortality, already briefly touched upon by Alchemists in their health-focused way of living, cryonics<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">“Cryonics is the practice of preserving life by pausing the dying process using subfreezing temperatures with the intent of restoring good health with medical technology in the future.” Alcor Life Extension Foundation, is currently in the hold of the first cryopreserved human James Hiram Bedford<br />

    <p>Let it be the physical or the immortality of the soul; however, the one I will be diving into is the symbolic immortality that is ensured through the lens of memory. This term was established by Harvard psychiatrist Robert J. Lifton, MD, referring to what comes before us and what remains of us after death, enabling us to participate in an ongoing life without denying the actuality of death. Symbolic implies that it conveys an idea, intention, or feeling with the absence of practical influence.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">"Symbolic." Cambridge Dictionary, dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/symbolic.

    </span></span> This thesis will focus on two aspects, the creative, which captures human creations and lasting influences on others which enter the human flow beyond the self, and the biological, generational continuality, within it. I am going to look at both through the personal experience and family. With this thesis, I wish to verbalize the concept of symbolic immortality and its attributes and propose it as a new possible method of dealing with loss.</p>
    <p>Experience occurs when our minds assign forms to our perceptions. Our sensory data and recognition are therefore closely related. Through the perception of senses, our inner psychic structures enable the possibility for recognition and assign meaning to these inner forms that inside of our minds exist as either clear or vague images and symbols. The most general psychic organization of these inner images and symbols takes place around mutual oppositions like connection and separation or movement and stasis. The most extreme form of stasis is death. Robert Jay Lifton and Eric Olson in their theory imply the finality of death and the human need for historical connection beyond an individual life. They believe that we, humans, need to develop symbols, imagery, and concepts in order to grant a sense of significance to our experience, which is a process most essential to what they called symbolical immortality. Without this everyday development and a sense of belonging would not be possible. Symbolic immortality is conclusively an ability to participate in everyday life without the necessity of denying the inevitable death.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Lifton, Robert Jay and Eric Olson. “Symbolic Immortality.” Death, Mourning and Burial: A Cross-cultural Reader.

<p>So where does this longing for eternal life initially come from, the need to feel remembered? Perhaps it is the fear that the life you lived becomes meaningless once you cease to exist, the fear of death itself, or the notion of not understanding how something that once lived and created can now simply vanish. Could it be the need for connection to others and back to ourselves? Maybe it is a reminder to upcoming generations or even other species of our accomplishments and the doom we brought upon ourselves. It could be our sense of self-importance, a deeply egotistical point of view, or even a political statement, a reminder of one’s achievements, beliefs, and legacy. And frankly, it may be all of the above.</p>

</span></span><em>). Death’s source lies in life itself and vice versa. A child’s conception and development occur at the mother’s expense; she is often endangered by the birth. The mother is depleted. Since she is not destroyed completely, the death component requires a substitute, a sacrifice. The plant is pulled out (it is born) while sprinkling either the blood of a sacrificial animal or urine. Both are death products (urine, excreta).” (Spielrein, 1994)</em></p>
<p>Spielrein, suggesting destruction as the basis of creation, further describes: “No change can take place without destruction of the former condition.” In her text, she points out the rituals of different cultures as a way to honor new life through sacrifice or inanimate symbols. She talks of our modern conscious thought process and its disability to conform to our complex, impossible-to-grasp, psychic ideas. Such images, nevertheless, can be found in the mythological and imaginative creations of our ancestor’s consciousness, on which she largely bases her examples.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Spielrein, Sabina. <em>Destruction as the Cause of Coming into Being.</em> Journal of Analytical Psychology, Vienna, 1994. pp. 4, 20-21.<br />

</span></span> Agreeing with her thoughts on death and life overlapping, I recognize a strong impact of our ancestral presence. Not only to base our beliefs on but to thank them for our existence as they sacrificed theirs. Therefore, the biological component unravels here through myth and ritual, and generations of our ancestors.</p>
<p>Within this chapter, I wish to expose another concept; the one of ambiguous loss. This term was first used by Pauline Boss, former psychotherapist, researcher, writer, and currently a professor at the University of Minnesota, describing unclear loss with no possibility of closure existing either on a physical or psychological level.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Hanson, Mary.

</span></span> I shall treat this idea in the same way as the one of Lifton’s symbolic immortality and Spielrein’s sexual instinct, fundamentally existing on a spectrum between life and death in the means of understanding how I can grieve a person, who I had lost, not by the cause of death, but distance.</p>
<p>The last time we talked on the phone, you told me you wanted to die. In your eyes, death is the ultimate answer to everything; a space where all you had ever wondered or doubted suddenly reaches perfect clarity. You were so convinced of what you were saying. I got worried and tried to talk you out of it, but you would not listen. When I hung up the phone that night, I was not able to fall asleep. I could not stop but feel like you are already dead. As if the conversation we just had never even happened, and I made you up in my mind to say things that I myself could never say out loud.</p>
